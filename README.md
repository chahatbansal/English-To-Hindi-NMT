# English-To-Hindi-NMT
Language translation is one task in which machine is definitely lagging behind the cognitive powers of human beings. Statistical Machine Translation is one of the conventional ways of solving the problem of machine translation. This method requires huge data sets and performs well on similar grammar structured language pairs. In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has emerged as an alternate way of addressing the same issue. 
This project helps in translating English language text to Hindi language text.
